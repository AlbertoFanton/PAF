#Â Testing the user agent

1/ you need to install the resource-agents package of your distribution. This
   package contains the "ocft" script needed to run these tests.

2/ if needed, export the following environment variables:

     PGDATA        (default is /tmp/pgdata1) Where to create the PostrgeSQL
                   instance used for the tests
     PGBIN         (default is /usr/pgsql-9.3/bin) Location of the
                   PostrgeSQL binaries
     RESOURCE_NAME (default is pgsqld) The resource name used by the RA
     PGHOST        (default is /tmp) Ip address or socket directory to
                   connect to the server

   Warning, the instance in PGDATA is created for tests, then __destructed__.

3/ Make sure the HA_RSCTMP folder exists. On most Linux distribution it
is located in "/var/run/resource-agents/".

4/ to build the test scripts, run the following command as root:

     ocft make pgsqlms

5/ to actually run the tests, run the following command as root:

     ocft test pgsqlms

6/ to have some debug, run:

     ocft test -v pgsqlms
